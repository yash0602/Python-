Re-created the Job Likelihood using Python

# Job-Landing-Likelihood
It is hard for international students to land a job mainly due to 2 reasons - 1) High competition 2) Low job openings(Jon Density). This data analysis shows that there is a higher chance of landing a job in cities where graduation rate is low and demand of job is more.

1. Retrieved data of univerisites/schools in all the US cities from opportunity atlas 
2. Retrieved data of Job density and Graduation rate from opportunity atlas
3. Used VLOOKUP function to extract all the data sets into a single Excel sheet 
4. Used COUNT.IF statement to get the total count of univerisites/school per city 
5. Used pivot table and pivot graph to analyze the data

# Python code
1. Selected three top cities that I wanted to work in
2. Used data frame melt function to aggregate Employment and Job density data into one single variable name 
3. Plotted a graph using melf table to visually analyse the result
